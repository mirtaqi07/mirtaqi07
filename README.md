# ðŸ‘‹ Hello friend!

Welcome to my blog! I'm **Mir Qasim Taqi** and I recentrly completed my Bachelor's of Science in **Mechatronics and Control Engineering** from **UET Lahore, Faisalabad campus**.

I have a diverse range of interests, including coding for mircrocontrollers, playing with motors, building robots *(not as advanced as Boston Dynamics :-)* and developing mobile/desktop/web applications. I have a passion for image processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. During my free time, I enjoy taking on challenging projects that are unknown to me.
